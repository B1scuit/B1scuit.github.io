title: Why vim?
categories: Random

I use vim as my day to day code editor, I would be reluctant to call it an IDE since it's really not.

Out of the box, vim can be a handful, since (Thanks to work) I use a mac with the touch bar thing, hitting escape is a ballache so I have my [.vimrc](https://github.com/B1scuit/Handy-Scripts/blob/master/Linux/dotFiles/.vimrc) file there to just make everything easier, 

Anyway, why vim? Well a bunch of reasons, I used to use Atom as my day to day IDE which, don't get me wrong, is a fantastic platform, really hackable and you can get it doing just about anything, but I did find some drawbacks, for example, its based on Electron and as a NodeJS thing can be pretty slow at times.
Things like the fuzzy finder and opening the damn thing take forever, now I'm not a patient person, so waiting for an age for everything to get going irritates the hell out of me. Also every server I would remote into and config would need the use of vim anyway (since nano can f**k off) meaning I was using it all the time anyway.

I know there are things like Notepad++ out there, however I'm buried in terminals all day and I need something that can work across *nix OS's.

I've dabbled in vim in the past, normally on servers when nano was being a tard, so I had some basic knowledge of it, however, it wasn't until a colleague of mine at work who already used vim day to day forwarded me his .vimrc, from there I used MacVim or MVim for a while, until I discovered it had many issues, too many to name.

To be fair it was a shaky start, learning all the keyboard shortcuts, however, after a while, I had a setup using iTerm2, vim and FZF which was lightning fast and could rip through any project astonishingly quick, bye bye Atom.

I'm a man of speed, I don't like things slow and I have no patience, if I want to get something done, I want it already finished and my setup now caters to that.

TL;DR: 

Atom was too slow, MVim too buggy, iTerm2, Vim and FZF search, just right.
